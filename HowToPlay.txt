This game is Egyptian War, with 2-4 people able to play at the same time.
At the start of the game, each person is dealt a card one by one until all of the cards are passed out, resulting in each player having a roughly equal amount of cards. The players are not allowed to see their cards.

Players then take turns placing cards with the following rules:
-If a Jack is placed, the next player has to place down 1 card, if that is a face card, then the next player goes, and if it is not a face card, then the player who played the Jack wins the pile
-If a Queen is placed, the next player has to place down 2 cards, if one is a face card, then the next player goes, and if it is not a face card, then the player who played the Queen wins the pile
-If a King is placed, the next player has to place down 3 cards, if one is a face card, then the next player goes, and if it is not a face card, then the player who played the King wins the pile
-If an Ace is placed, the next player has to place down 4 cards, if one is a face card, then the next player goes, and if it is not a face card, then the player who played the Ace wins the pile
-The game ends when only one player has cards left. Players lose when they run out of cards

Additionally, there are slaps. If a player slaps and is correct, then they win the pile. Otherwise, they have to burn a card, which is adding a card to the bottom of the pile (this card is not in play, and goes to the winner of the pile when won)

Valid slaps are defined before the game starts, and are listed below:
-Doubles: if two cards placed in a row are the same rank
  -Example: a 9 is placed, and then another 9 is placed (or in other words: 9 9)
-Sandwiches: if the first and third of the three top-most cards placed are the same rank
  -Example: 9 4 9
-Marriages: if the two top-most cards are a Q and K or a K and Q
  -Example: K Q
-Divorces: if the first and third of the three top-most cards placed are a Q and K or a K and Q
  -Example: Q 9 K
-Divorces: if the first and third of the three top-most cards placed are a J and K or a K and J
  -Example: K A J
-Sequences: If the three top-most cards placed are consecutive and in increasing or decreasing order
  -Examples: 4 5 6 or 9 8 7
  -Incorrect: 9 7 8 or 5 4 6
